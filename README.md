# Learning TypeScript

Typescript is a statically typed language and is considered better as compared to the dynamically typed JavaScript, since it results in better error detection. It is a strongly typed language and the types are specified properly & checked at compile time, unlike JS where in the types are checked at run time.

This repository covers some basic aspects of Typescript & basic projects based on that of typescript. 


### Command to be used for typescrpt:

Use the following command before using typescript in your compiler. However, when using Vite project, there is no need to use this command as the project has pre-installed dependencies of Typescript.

```
npm install -g typescript
```
